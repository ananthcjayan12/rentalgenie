## 🚀 Phase 1 - DETAILED TESTING CHECKLIST:

### ✅ 1. Installation Verification
- [x] App installed successfully without errors
- [ ] Check installation log for any warnings

### 🧪 2. Custom Fields Testing

#### Test 2.1: Item Form Structure
- [ ] Navigate to **Stock → Item → New**
- [ ] Verify "Rental Configuration" section appears after Image field
- [ ] Verify section is collapsible
- [ ] Check all fields are present in correct order:
  - [ ] "Enable for Rental" (Checkbox)
  - [ ] "Rental Rate (₹/day)" (Currency) - should appear only when checkbox is checked
  - [ ] "Item Category" (Select) - options: Dress, Ornament, Accessory, Other
  - [ ] "Current Status" (Select) - default: Available
  - [ ] "Approval Status" (Read-only) - default: Pending Approval
- [ ] Verify "Third Party Owner Details" section appears and is collapsible
- [ ] Check third party fields:
  - [ ] "Third Party Owned" (Checkbox)
  - [ ] "Owner Commission %" - appears only when third party is checked
  - [ ] "Owner (Supplier)" - Link to Supplier doctype

#### Test 2.2: Field Dependencies
- [x ] **Test "Enable for Rental" dependency:**
  - Uncheck "Enable for Rental" → rental fields should disappear
  - Check "Enable for Rental" → rental fields should appear
- [ ] **Test "Third Party Owned" dependency:**
  - Uncheck → commission and supplier fields disappear
  - Check → commission and supplier fields appear
- [ ] **Test mandatory validation:**
  - Enable rental → try to save without rental rate → should show error

### 🧪 3. Item Groups Testing
- [ ] Navigate to **Stock → Item Group**
- [ ] Verify these groups were created:
  - [ ] "Rental Items" (parent: All Item Groups)
  - [ ] "Dresses" (parent: Rental Items)  
  - [ ] "Ornaments" (parent: Rental Items)
  - [ ] "Accessories" (parent: Rental Items)

### 🧪 4. Item Automation Testing

#### Test 4.1: Create Rental Item (Own Item)
- [ ] Create new item with these details:
  - Item Code: `TEST-DRESS-001`
  - Item Name: `Test Wedding Dress`
  - Enable for Rental: ✅
  - Rental Rate: `500`
  - Item Category: `Dress`
  - Third Party Owned: ❌ (unchecked)
- [ ] **Save the item**
- [ ] **Verify automation worked:**
  - [ ] Item Group automatically set to "Dresses"
  - [ ] Stock UOM set to "Nos"
  - [ ] Is Stock Item = 1
  - [ ] Include Item in Manufacturing = 0
  - [ ] Is Fixed Asset = 0

#### Test 4.2: Verify Service Item Creation
- [ ] Navigate to **Stock → Item** 
- [ ] Search for `TEST-DRESS-001-RENTAL`
- [ ] **Verify service item was created with:**
  - [ ] Item Name: "Test Wedding Dress - Rental Service"
  - [ ] Item Group: "Services"
  - [ ] Is Stock Item = 0 (service item)
  - [ ] Is Sales Item = 1
  - [ ] Standard Rate = 500 (same as rental rate)

#### Test 4.3: Create Third Party Item
- [ ] Create another item:
  - Item Code: `TEST-ORN-001`
  - Item Name: `Test Gold Necklace`
  - Enable for Rental: ✅
  - Rental Rate: `1000`
  - Item Category: `Ornament`
  - Third Party Owned: ✅
  - Owner Commission %: `30`
- [ ] **Save the item**
- [ ] **Verify automation:**
  - [ ] Item Group set to "Ornaments"
  - [ ] Service item `TEST-ORN-001-RENTAL` created
  - [ ] Auto-created supplier with name like "Owner-TEST-ORN-001"

#### Test 4.4: Verify Supplier Creation
- [ ] Navigate to **Buying → Supplier**
- [ ] Search for supplier created (e.g., "Owner-TEST-ORN-001")
- [ ] **Verify supplier details:**
  - [ ] Supplier Type: "Individual"
  - [ ] Supplier Group: "Local"

### 🧪 5. Database Verification
- [ ] **Check custom fields in database:**
  ```bash
  bench --site your-site.localhost mariadb
  ```
  ```sql
  desc tabItem;
  ```
  - [ ] Verify rental custom fields exist in Item table
  - [ ] Check field names are correct (snake_case)

- [ ] **Check data integrity:**
  ```sql
  SELECT item_code, item_name, is_rental_item, rental_rate_per_day, 
         rental_item_type, current_rental_status 
  FROM tabItem 
  WHERE is_rental_item = 1;
  ```

### 🧪 6. Error Handling Testing

#### Test 6.1: Validation Testing
- [ ] **Test missing rental rate:**
  - Enable rental → leave rental rate empty → save
  - Should show: "Rental Rate Per Day is mandatory for rental items"

#### Test 6.2: Create duplicate items
- [ ] Try creating item with same item code
- [ ] Should show standard ERPNext duplicate error

### 🧪 7. UI/UX Testing
- [ ] **Form layout looks good:**
  - [ ] Fields are properly arranged
  - [ ] Column breaks work correctly
  - [ ] Sections collapse/expand properly
- [ ] **Field labels are clear and appropriate**
- [ ] **Default values are set correctly**

### 🧪 8. Permission Testing
- [ ] **Log in as different user roles and verify access:**
  - [ ] Stock Manager can create rental items
  - [ ] Sales User can view rental items
  - [ ] Test role-based permissions work as expected

### 🧪 9. Performance Testing
- [ ] **Create multiple rental items (5-10) and verify:**
  - [ ] Form loads quickly
  - [ ] Save operation is fast
  - [ ] List view shows items correctly

## ✅ Phase 1 Sign-off Criteria:
**Before moving to Phase 2, ALL of the above tests should pass. Specifically verify:**

1. ✅ **Item rental fields appear and work correctly**
2. ✅ **Item groups are created properly**  
3. ✅ **Service items are auto-created for rental items**
4. ✅ **Third-party supplier logic works**
5. ✅ **Field dependencies and validations work**
6. ✅ **No JavaScript/Python errors in browser console**

---

## 🚨 Common Issues to Watch For:
- **Custom fields not showing**: Clear cache and reload
- **Service item not created**: Check error logs
- **Supplier not created**: Verify permissions
- **Validation errors**: Check field dependencies

**If any test fails, we'll debug before proceeding to Phase 2!**

## 🚀 Next Steps:
1. Implement Phase 1: Basic Setup
2. Test Item custom fields creation
3. Verify automation works
4. Move to Phase 2: Item Management

## 📋 Implementation Notes:
- Using 6-day rental window (2 days before + 4 days after function)
- Manual caution deposit entry (no automation)
- Dry cleaning tracked as expense only
- Owner commission auto-updated in ledger
